# Twine-1.4.2-Stem-Mixing-Template
For demonstrating your musical ideas in Twine.

This template will teach you how to make a Twine that runs a stem additive/subtractive/mixing musical system in a browser. 

It works seamlessly in Firefox with wav and ogg loops. It works seamlessly in Chrome with wav and there's a little gap on loop in Chrome with ogg. Other browsers may or may not work.

There's no instruction on how to actually make a Twine, or what Twine is, you have to learn by poking it. (Or have prior knowledge.) 

This assumes you'll be able to compose music in stem additive/subtractive/mixing musical structures. The demo project is an example of subdivision.

You'll need Twine 1.4.2. https://twinery.org/
It uses the Howler JS library. https://howlerjs.com/

The music teacher in charge of this project structure is me; Meg @indiegames_muso (Feel welcome to ask me a question.)
